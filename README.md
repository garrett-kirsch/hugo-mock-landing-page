# hugo-mock-landing-page

This is an altered webpage from an existing theme: hugo-bootstrap.

## The Product

The webpage is a landing page for a product that I did QA testing for called Pieces for Developers. It's a really cool dev tool that is basically a code snippet saver and LLM wrapper, but if you try it out you'll find that it is very polished and user friendly.

I chose this product for my little project because I have spent a lot of time with Pieces and understand it very well. I also really like the people behind the product - the Pieces team is really cool!
