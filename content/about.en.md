# About Us

We are a team of Cincinnati-based developers who understand the pain of losing valuable code. We've experienced firsthand the frustration of sifting through project files, Slack messages, and Stack Overflow bookmarks. So, we built Pieces to ensure that no great piece of code—or idea—ever gets lost again.
